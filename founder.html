                    I have always believed that the most interesting place to be is where two distinct forces collide.
                    My journey has taken me from a small village in Alaska to studios around the world, but my
                    philosophy remains the same: real magic happens at the intersection.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    I’m building this resource because <strong>ALS runs in my family</strong>. I’ve seen first-hand the
                    need for quality of life improvements for people with mobility issues or those who are recovering
                    from injury.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    It became clear to me that AR and VR technology shouldn't just be for gaming or enterprise—it can be
                    implemented in a way that tangibly improves people’s lives. Whether it's providing a digital escape,
                    a new way to interact with the world, or a tool for rehabilitation, the potential is limitless.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    In 2024, I founded Revivor Studios. The name is a union of "Survivor" and "Revive"—a testament to
                    those simply surviving their conditions, and a promise to help revive their sense of wonder. We
                    build VR and AR experiences specifically for people with challenging physical disabilities, limited
                    mobility, or phobias.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    My goal is to use my decades of technical expertise to build tools that don't just distract, but
                    heal. We are expanding worlds for those whose physical space has become limited, proving that while
                    the body may be confined, the human experience should remain boundless.
